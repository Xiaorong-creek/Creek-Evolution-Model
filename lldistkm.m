% format: [d1km d2km]=lldistkm(latlon1,latlon2)
% Distance:
% d1km: distance in km based on Haversine formula
% (Haversine: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula)
% d2km: distance in km based on Pythagorasâ€™ theorem
% (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem)
% After:
% http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html
%
% --Inputs:
%   latlon1: latlon of origin point [lat lon]
%   latlon2: latlon of destination point [lat lon]
%
% --Outputs:
%   d1km: distance calculated by Haversine formula
%   d2km: distance calculated based on Pythagoran theorem
%
% --Example 1, short distance:
%   latlon1=[-43 172];
%   latlon2=[-44  171];
%   [d1km d2km]=distance(latlon1,latlon2)
%   d1km =
%           137.365669065197 (km)
%   d2km =
%           137.368179013869 (km)
%   %d1km approximately equal to d2km
%
% --Example 2, longer distance:
%   latlon1=[-43 172];
%   latlon2=[20  -108];
%   [d1km d2km]=distance(latlon1,latlon2)
%   d1km =
%           10734.8931427602 (km)
%   d2km =
%           31303.4535270825 (km)
%   d1km is significantly different from d2km (d2km is not able to work
%   for longer distances).
